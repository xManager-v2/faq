## General Questions

### What platforms are supported?

xManager supports Android. If your Chrome OS device supports Android then it'll work there as well. There are no current plans to support Windows, MacOS, Linux etc. 

If you are determined to run this on a non-android device then fire up an Android emulator. 

### Where to download the latest version?

You can always grab the latest version of xManager right here on GitHub. 

See [the `github.com/xManager-v2/xManager-Spotify` releases section](https://github.com/xManager-v2/xManager-Spotify/releases).

### Why is xManager showing an older version as 'Latest'?

Sometimes the previous cached version is shown instead of the true latest version, pull down in the app to refresh page. 

### Do I use Armeabi or Arm64?

xManager should show which to use under the "MANAGER TOOLS" section where it says "Device CPU". If still unsure, Armeabi-v7a should almost always work.
